# VBA-challenge
Module 2 Challenge
In this repositry I have uploaded a wordfile with screenshots for the three years of data and the bonus section, I have also uploaded the VBA code as a txt seperate file. 

To create the code I used code from analysistabs.com and used the code "Columns ("X").ColumnWidth = desired column width " To alter the width of some of the new columns so all the data was visable. 
To find the greatest perecentage increase, decrease and the greatest total volume I used code from forum.ozgrid.com from Reafidy "Max = Application.WorksheetFunction.Max(Columns("x")) and "Min = Application.WorksheetFunction.Min (Columns("x"))". 
To change the percentage change column to a percentage i used the function .NumberFormat = "0.00%" which I got from automateexcel.
To make my code run across all worksheets I declared ws as a variable and used with ws at the start of everysubroutine which I learned on automateexel.
